        role: Developer with responsibility for the administration tool and resident Ruby expert.
        benefit: With a limited budget, Jimmy was able to upgrade the code base and production environment to the latest versions, and caught up with long postponed maintenance work required to keep the product stable and secure.

        role: Tech lead responsible for the development of the platform, and backend developer on the team.
        benefit: An MVP was created, demonstrating the most important use cases and serving as a solid foundation for further development, and approaching the capabilities of fully replacing the legacy system.

      mentice-admin:
        project: Maintenance and development of an administration tool managing the company’s endovascular surgery simulator.
        role: Sole developer responsible for maintaining the administration tool.

        role: Jimmy was a part of the team in charge of developing the product’s core functionality during a period of high pressure to deliver a customer integration. He improved automatic testing of the code base, and did acceptance testing on site at a police station in England.
        benefit: Increased stability of the system, while new requirements were met within narrow time constraints.

      dawanda:
        project: The company ran an e-commerce platform connecting buyers and sellers of home-made goods. The work consisted of tackling scaling issues as the number of users grew, and refactoring and adding new functionality without causing downtime.

        benefit: The stability of the system markedly improved from having significant downtime almost every week to just a few minutes per month. Meanwhile, complex functionality could be developed and delivered as developer productivity increased.
